My name is Nico Jimenez.  I dropped out of Stanford to create Mathpix (<https://mathpix.com>), an image processing API that processes 20 million images per month for millions of users across the globe.

I am also the creator of Losswise (<https://losswise.com>), an internal ML monitoring and analytics solution built at Mathpix that is now publicly available.
