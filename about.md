My name is Nico Jimenez.  I dropped out of my PhD program at Stanford to create Mathpix (<https://mathpix.com>), an OCR API specialized in math and handwriting that processes about 1 million images per day for millions of users across the globe for a variety of applications in education.  Working with talented engineers to develop reliable computer vision software that feels like magic and saves people time is what gets me out of bed every morning.

I am also the creator of Losswise (<https://losswise.com>), an internal ML monitoring and analytics solution built at Mathpix that is now publicly available.
