My name is Nico Jimenez.  I dropped out of my PhD program at Stanford to create Mathpix (<https://mathpix.com>) and more recently Losswise (<https://losswise.com>).  Working with talented engineers to develop reliable AI software that feels like magic and saves people time is what gets me out of bed every morning.
