The purpose of my blog is to make the internet a better place by providing high quality tutorials on machine learning and software in general.  This site is made with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) which I highly recommend to anyone who wants to spare people pain they themselves had to go through.

You can learn more about me on my [personal site](http://nicodjimenez.com/).
